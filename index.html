                    <h2>The Critical Missing Element</h2>
                    <h3>Why are we not getting this vital mineral from our food supply? </h3>
                    <p> You may be eating a healthy balanced diet and yet can still identify with some of magnesium deficiency’s most severe symptoms.
                        
                    Because of modern food processing, our 
                    environment has been stripped of vital 
                    nutrients, specifically magnesium . Because 
                    of this, there’s no longer adequate amounts 
                    of magnesium in the food supply. This 
                    alarming fact means the majority of 
                    Americans are magnesium deficient, and are 
                    suffering the consequences.

                    See if you can identify with some of magnesium deficiency's most debilitating symptoms:
