                        Review of MagSRT
                    “I buy the MagSRT from Jigsaw and lind that it is a great product. Not only does it help my husband and I with intestinal health, but I Und if I forget to take it a day or two, my legs just ache at night when I go to sleep, and I wake often from the pain. I know that every cell in your body needs magnesium, and for heart health as well as bone health. I will never stop buying this product for myself and my husband! 5 Thumbs Up on this product!”
